# SPIRV-Reflect

**NOTE: the `master` branch has been renamed to `main` (see #164
for details).  Please update your fork as per instructions in
that issue.**

SPIRV-Reflect is a lightweight library that provides a C/C++ reflection API for
[SPIR-V](https://www.khronos.org/spir/) shader bytecode in
[Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) applications.

SPIRV-Reflect has been tested on Linux and Windows.

## Features

- Extract descriptor bindings from SPIR-V bytecode, to assist in the generation of
  Vulkan descriptor set and pipeline layouts.
- Extract push constant block size from SPIR-V bytecode to assist in the generation
  of pipeline layouts.
- Extract full layout data for uniform buffer and push constant blocks from SPIR-V
  bytecode, to assist in application updates of these structures.
- Extract input/output variables from SPIR-V bytecode (including semantic decorations
  for HLSL shaders), to assist in validation of pipeline input/output settings.
- Remap descriptor bindings at runtime, and update the source SPIR-V bytecode
  accordingly.
- Log all reflection data as human-readable text.

## Integration

SPIRV-Reflect is designed to make integration as easy as possible. The only
external dependency is the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home).

To integrate SPIRV-Reflect into a project, simply add `spirv_reflect.h` and
`spirv_reflect.c` in the project's build, and include `spirv_reflect.h` from
the necessary source files.

## Building Samples

**This step is only necessary when building/running SPIRV-Reflect's example applications.**

SPIRV-Reflect includes a collection of sample programs in the `examples/` directory which
demonstrate various use cases:

- **descriptors**: This sample demonstrates the retrieval of descriptor bindings, including
  the population of `VkDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo` structures from reflection data.
- **hlsl_resource_types**: This sample shows how various HLSL resource types are represented
  in SPIR-V.
- **io_variables**: This sample demonstrates the retrieval of input/output variables, including
  the population of `VkPipelineVertexInputStateCreateInfo` structures from reflection data.

To build the included sample applications, use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to generate the
appropriate project files for your platform, then build them as usual.

Note that you can set VulkanSDK directory as your preference. For example, on Linux:
```
VULKAN_SDK=$HOME/VulkanSDK/1.1.70.1/x86_64 cmake -G Ninja  ..
```


## Usage

SPIRV-Reflect's core C API should be familiar to Vulkan developers:

```c++
#include "spirv_reflect.h"

int SpirvReflectExample(const void* spirv_code, size_t spirv_nbytes)
{
  // Generate reflection data for a shader
  SpvReflectShaderModule module;
  SpvReflectResult result = spvReflectCreateShaderModule(spirv_nbytes, spirv_code, &module);
  assert(result == SPV_REFLECT_RESULT_SUCCESS);

  // Enumerate and extract shader's input variables
  uint32_t var_count = 0;
  result = spvReflectEnumerateInputVariables(&module, &var_count, NULL);
  assert(result == SPV_REFLECT_RESULT_SUCCESS);
  SpvReflectInterfaceVariable** input_vars =
    (SpvReflectInterfaceVariable**)malloc(var_count * sizeof(SpvReflectInterfaceVariable*));
  result = spvReflectEnumerateInputVariables(&module, &var_count, input_vars);
  assert(result == SPV_REFLECT_RESULT_SUCCESS);

  // Output variables, descriptor bindings, descriptor sets, and push constants
  // can be enumerated and extracted using a similar mechanism.

  // Destroy the reflection data when no longer required.
  spvReflectDestroyShaderModule(&module);
}
```

A C++ wrapper is also provided.

## Building Self-Test Suite

SPIRV-Reflect uses [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) for self-testing.
This component is optional, and generally only of interest to developers modifying SPIRV-Reflect.
To run the self-tests:

- `git submodule init`
- `git submodule update`
- Enable `SPIRV_REFLECT_BUILD_TESTS` in CMake
- Build and run the `test-spirv-reflect` project.

## Bazel build

We tested the following bazel build command using Linux Bazel 1.2.1.
```
bazel build :all
```
